		<b>Dustin</b><br>
		Dustin Henderson, portrayed by Gaten Matarazzo, is a major protagonist in the first three seasons of Stranger Things. He is best friends with Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair , Eleven, Will Byers, and Max Mayfield. In 1983, when Dustin's friend, Will went missing, Dustin and the rest of his friends, Mike and Lucas went out to look for him, only to find a mysterious girl named Eleven who had telekinetic powers. Dustin had a neutral opinion of Eleven as she helped them look for Will, but he became good friends with her after she saved him and Mike from being killed by their school bullies. Dustin would continue to help his friends find Will and fight against a Demogorgon until it was killed by Eleven. In the end, Dustin and his friends were reunited with Will where they celebrated Christmas together.
