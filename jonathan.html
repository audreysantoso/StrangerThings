		<b>Jonathan</b><br>
		Jonathan Byers, portrayed by starring cast member Charlie Heaton, is a major character in Stranger Things. He is the older brother of Will Byers. His life was turned upside down following the disappearance of his younger brother. In 1983, when Jonathan's younger brother, Will went missing due Jonathan working late, he and his mother searched for him with the help of Chief Hopper and the police. However, when Hawkins National Laboratory faked Will's "death," Jonathan's relationship with his mother became strained who had insisted that Will was actually alive and was communicating with her. Jonathan soon realized his mother was telling the truth, due to meeting Nancy Wheeler who also have claimed to see the "monster" that Jonathan's mother had seen when trying to reach Will.
