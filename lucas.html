		<b>Lucas</b><br>
		Lucas Charles Sinclair, portrayed by Caleb McLaughlin, is a major protagonist of Stranger Things. He is best friends with Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, Will Byers and Eleven. In 1983, Lucas's friend, Will mysteriously vanished so Lucas and the rest of his friends, Mike and Dustin went out to look for him, only to meet a girl named Eleven who had telekinetic powers. Lucas was wary of Eleven and found her weird and hardly believed in supernatural circumstances of Will's disappearance. However, when Lucas realized that Eleven was trying to protect him and his friends from the dangers of Hawkins National Laboratory and the Upside Down, his opinion of her changed and he became good friends with her. Lucas continued to help his friends and battle the Demogorgon until it was killed by Eleven. In the end, Lucas was reunited with Will and celebrated Christmas with his friends.
