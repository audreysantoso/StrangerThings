		<b>Steve</b><br>
		Steven ''Steve'' Harrington, portrayed by Joe Keery, is a major protagonist of Stranger Things, having a recurring role in season one before being upgraded to a major role as of season 2. A student at Hawkins High School, he was friends with Tommy H. and Carol Perkins and the boyfriend of Nancy Wheeler. When Nancy's best friend, Barbara Holland, disappeared, she became distant and Steve thought she was cheating with Jonathan Byers. Following a few ignorant actions, Steve had a change of heart, told his friends off, and set out to make things right. By coincidence, he ended up heroically saving the day and reconciled with his girlfriend. Prior to dating Nancy, Steve was well known among his peers as a popular boy with a terrible personality. He is a pretty boy and was called King Steve as a title to his high popularity.
